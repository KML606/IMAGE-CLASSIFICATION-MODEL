Task Description:
In this project, the objective is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images using a deep learning framework—either TensorFlow or PyTorch. CNNs are particularly powerful for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically detect and learn spatial hierarchies of features.

We’ll use TensorFlow (with Keras) for this implementation because of its beginner-friendly API and tight integration with Jupyter environments. The task involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the images, constructing a CNN architecture, training the model, and finally evaluating its performance on a test dataset.

For simplicity and clarity, we use the CIFAR-10 dataset—a well-known collection of 60,000 color images in 10 different classes (airplane, cat, dog, etc.), which is readily available through TensorFlow’s datasets module.

The deliverable should contain:

Import of required libraries

Dataset loading and preprocessing

CNN model architecture

Model training with validation

Evaluation on test set (accuracy, loss)

Visualization of training curves (accuracy/loss vs epochs)

This entire workflow is executable within Visual Studio Code using the Python extension with Jupyter support.
